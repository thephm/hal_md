> My eldest is going into Mechanical Engineering; it's just a matter of which university. She's been accepted to Ryerson, U Ottawa and McMaster; U of T and Waterloo are still pending -- she didn't get early admission, but also hasn't been outright rejected. I think we find out this month. She's leaning towards McMaster  I'm glad you and Ashley still get along. He's still the best boss/PM I've ever had.  My wife's still working at Sick Kids as an RN. She's also taken a job as a vaccinator. I'm still working away as a Business Systems Analyst in IT Supply Chain Healthcare at Plexxus. Weirdly, Covid has changed our jobs only slightly...
