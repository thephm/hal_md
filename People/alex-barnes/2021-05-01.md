> Hi Alex, so awesome to hear from you! I've been at Cogeco for almost 9 years which is kind of crazy but they treated me well. On the personal side, we're now grandparents to an awesome 2 year old girl. Our son and the Mom are not together but we get to see the little one every Sun. How about yourself? Hope all is good and that you are healthy

> It's awesome you are grandparents! Sad that the little girl's mommy and daddy are separated though. I bet she loves seeing you on Sundays!  We are all doing reasonably OK. The kids grow so fast -- my eldest is headed off to university in the fall...  Do you still keep in touch with Ashley Lindsay at all? Things got so crazy busy when the kids were little that I lost touch with everyone I met at Nortel
