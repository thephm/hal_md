Me: Hi Alex, that innovation network sounds like a great idea! I've been  under a rock for past 9 ish years so I'm not sure how much I could contribute. 
    
Alex: I'm sure there's lots for you to contribute! You'll need something interesting to look forward to doing in retirement once the grandkids are in school and everything
     
The event itself is reasonably low commitment -- you can simply watch -- but chances are you'll find it hard not to jump right in...

Me: Thanks Alex! Ok may sign up. Always love networking
