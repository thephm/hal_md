Hey, that's good to hear. I did look at the tool - wow, lots of info!
Re: jobs, things are going OK; I just keep plugging away...
Thanks,

I haven't had a moment to type up my networking book notes and don't   think I will in the short term as the job search is picking up. I do   recommend picking up Never Eat Alone as I enjoyed it (bright orange   book, I used to read it eating lunch alone!).
Did you get a chance to view my system? I removed access for now as I   hadn't heard back.
Hope things are well on the job front.
All the best, Bernie
