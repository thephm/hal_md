Thanks Bernie.  Yep, I start at a place called Plexxus today: www.plexxus.ca

I got your e-mails, but haven't had a chance to read them yet.

Congrats on RIM!  Which location and what are you going to be doing there?

Hi Alex, Ashley mentioned you had landed, CONGRATS That's awesome news!   Where did you end up choosing? I am heading off to work at RIM starting   on Feb 25 so I'm pumped about that. Did you receive my emails with the   notes from the books? 

All the best in the new job! Bernie
