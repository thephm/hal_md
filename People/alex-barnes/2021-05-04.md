> Oh, that's so awesome she's already accepted into  3 universities! You and your wife must be so proud.  It must be stressful with your wife being an RN during COVID. That's so selfless to do vaccinations, kudos to her!  Congrats on still being at Plexxus, that's over a decade I think. Huge accomplishment and BSA can be very challenging and rewarding as you get to know the whole business.
