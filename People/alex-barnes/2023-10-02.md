Hi Alex,

Hope this email finds you well and celebrating your 30th! It's been a couple years I think, did your innovation network take off? How is your family doing? Last time we communicated your eldest hadn't decided which uni to go to, did she pick Mac?  

As part of my new job at Metrolinx I'm responsible for a cohort(s) of new grads, we're going to have another cohort in Jun 2024 (hopefully sooner) of 10 recent grads for Innovation & IT (I&IT). I know the Engineering folks also had a cohort so I can connect her if she's interested in either.

All the best on your special day!!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

Bernie

Hey, thanks Bernie! Yes, I'm celebrating my 30th with experience. Sadly, I have no innovation network to speak of, but it sounds like you have some interesting opportunities. My eldest is in her 3rd year of Mechanical Engineering at Mac. She might be interested in co-op at Metrolinx; who should she contact?

My family is doing well -- it's amazing how fast they grow up!

I hope you and your family are doing well.

Thanks,

 -Alex

Hi Alex,

So great to hear back! The person to connect with for co-op (and new grad program) is Jordan Cukier. He's on vacay this week and his LinkedIn is https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordancukier/ she should connect with him and mention my name

Things here are OK, work is great.

Talk soon!!

Best, Bernie
