Hi alex, I know of one guy who plays often, not sure if he's a fanatic but he may know of some. As a person he's not someone I necessarily want to keep in touch with but he was a friend of my sister-in-law. I can poke him if your interested. Worst case, he'll either have buddies that are fanatics or point you in the right direction ... l8r, bgj --

Hi Bernie, how's everything?

I've found what might be the perfect initial niche market for the Wearable Computing technology: location-based gaming (ex: Laser Tag).

To be sure, I'm looking to do some in-depth customer interviews to gauge the appeal of the product to see if it would revitalize the game.

Do you know anyone who is or was a die-hard laser tag fanatic?

Thanks, -Alex
