Good talking with you (as always).

I think extreme social networkers are the perfect niche (they are a super-set for journalists and salespeople, BTW).  If you can design a product to meet their needs, it will meet anyone's.

PIPEDA (Bill C-6) should be freaking them out, so you might be able to capitalize on that.

Re: "Panic Networkers"
People are turned off by this.  Why?
It's because the PN's are networking to help themselves.  There is no love.  If the people in your network were always looking for ways to add value, there'd be no problem.

See, capitalism is beautiful.  Too bad people over-focus on claiming value.  The flip side is someone like your wife (and the way I used to
be) -- an unshakable desire to help other people.  Problem is, it's not sustainable.

These two situations (over-claiming, under-claiming) are linked.  The over-claimers need to find out how to create value.  The under-claimers need to figure out how to claim value.  If instead of a resume, the PN was to offer you a useful service, you'd be more interested.  The problem with the chocolates is that it might make you feel guilty.  It may concern you that you now have an obligation to be nice to this person.

OK, so I'm not making any sense.  Ask me to explain this in-person or on the phone... Essentially it's Covey's "win-win" stuff, but much deeper...
