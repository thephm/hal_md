Hi Alex, 

How are you doing?

It's been eons since we talked and I hope this email finds you in good health and spirits.

I am still at Cogeco, been 5 years+ now and got my plaque to commemorate :)

All the best to you in 2018 and drop me a note to let me know how you're doing and what you've been up to.

All the best and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

Bernie
