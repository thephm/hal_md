Bernie, it was good to talk to you again.  I took a look at the pictures from the lights out party -- it looked like a lot of fun; I wish I'd been there.

This is my university e-mail address, so it should be good for at least the next year, if not longer.  I'd like to take you up on your offer to drop by
Soma some time in the next few weeks... I'll talk to you more about it once my mid-terms are over.
