Daughter's birthday today. Had a couple of interviews. eOutsource Solutions - internet marketing was bad, spammers/scam .... Applied Systems - insurance industry was a no go ... Rx Canada - interface b/w pharmacies and manufacturers, owned by Shoppers and others. He's also talking to Ashley Lindsay about helping him.
