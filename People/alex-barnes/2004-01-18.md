hi alex, love the small world! i got an email on Thursday from danish's brother-in-law who I know from my early bnr days telling me Danish is working at cibc!!

turns out he's in the same division (tech+ops). I'll definitely look him up this week.

re. rent-a-coder, i wouldn't use anyone I haven't interviewed or worked with write production code for me. renting a coder for $100 to do a one-page web site is fine. but as my dad always told me, you get what you pay for. you should see the garbage code some of my developers write at cibc. so if you want to maintain that and have it enhanced later it's gonna cost a lot more than if you paid someone experienced up-front.

how is your venture going?

we're considering sending a package to brighstpark this week. keep you posted.

all the best, bgj --

I'm curious, what would hold you back from using this for serious development?

-Alex P.S. Danish just recently got a job at CIBC in your same building (I told you he was a techie guy): Danish Ahmed Technology & Operations, CIBC (416) 784-8863
