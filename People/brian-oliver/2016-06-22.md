> Hey Bernie. What are you up to these days? I have moved to Seattle and am loving it. I was wondering if you'd be interested in discussing possible opportunities? I have positions in Toronto and Ottawa, as well as the US.

> Hi Brian, long time and congrats on the Amazon gig! Would love to hear what you think of the place. I did an interview with Zoran I back in 2012 after RIM. Not as technical as they needed. What is the role in Toronto and what product line/area? I have it pretty good at Cogeco with an actual life outside work although I've been keeping my eyes open since I miss software/product dev. Thanks for thinking of me! Bernie

> Hey Bernie. What role did you interview for?

Brian at 17:26

> I'm working on Alexa and we're doing some seriously cool things.

Brian at 17:27

> I'm looking for a number of different roles. I was thinking of a Technical program manager role for you potentially.

Bernie at 19:50

> Thanks Brian. the role wasn't clear back in 2012 something like software manager. My goal is to get back leading lean software teams with aspects of tech, people, and project leadership at a senior level. Alexa is pretty cool. Will  sleep on it!
