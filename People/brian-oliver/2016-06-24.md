> hi Brian, I slept on it and will lay low at Cogeco for a bit longer. there is a pending re-org coming and want to see what I will be getting. the urge to lead software will still be there. thanks again for thinking of me and let me know when you are in Toronto so we can catch up! all the best, Bernie
