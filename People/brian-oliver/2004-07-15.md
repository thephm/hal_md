How's it going? I know you interviewed at RIM a while back and based on the lucky_ones emails, I see you've landed somewhere again. I was wondering if you'd be interested in discussing some opportunities we have here now. Ping me an email and let me know how things are going and whether you'd be interested in discussing things
