> Grand daughter??? Man youâ€™re old ðŸ˜œ 

Brian at 13:30

> My eldest is 29 and talking about getting engaged. Heâ€™s in England and got laid off the week before Christmas. Still canâ€™t find a job. My daughter is 28 next week and lives in Ottawa. Sheâ€™s getting married next year. And my youngest is 29 and still at home/college. So no grand kids coming soon I donâ€™t think.

> Iâ€™ll be in Toronto from sun to sat next week. I was looking at the weather. ðŸ˜‘
