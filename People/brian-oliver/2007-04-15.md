We're doing well thanks. I've taking up training again (cycling and running). I'm doing about 10 duathlons this summer and may try a triathlon at the end of the summer. So that is consuming any free time I have after work and family. This generally translates into using some of my sleep time. I will be in Miss a number of times over the next little while. I'll see if I can pop down for lunch or a quick chat at least.
