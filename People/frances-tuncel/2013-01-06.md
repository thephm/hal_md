Happy New Year Frances! Wicked photo, what breed is the puppy? (s)he's so cute!
Frances Tuncel:
Happy New Year to you as well. The puppy is a bichon poodle cross. He is a handful but lots of fun. How's the new job?  How's your family?
ï£« *CA* Bernie:
Very cool! Job is ok they treat me well, home is ongoing battle (lots to talk about there!). Have you had any trips lately?
Frances Tuncel:
I'm heading back to Florida next week. My dad is having surgery so I'm going to support him and my mom. I don't think I'll get to do any fun travel until next year.  Sorry to hear about the ongoing battles. I'm having some of my own so I can sort of relate. I keep telling myself "this too shall pass". It makes me feel a little better. I know several people who faced great challenges parenting teens and ultimately things got a whole lot better. So stay hopeful! Glad to hear they treat you well at work!
ï£« *CA* Bernie:
Oh man sorry to hear things are not going well and about your Dad's surgery too :( I head to Waterloo once in a while for some Communitech/agile events so it would be great to catch up. Let me know when you're back. I hope the surgery goes well and things with our teens turn around soon!
