Hi Bernie,
That's wonderful news! I've never been through an assessment and don't know anyone who has. Have you done anything with Right Everywhere yet? I finally went to their getting started program and it was better than i expected. They offer a lot of services and 1-1 coaching. Their coaches may be familiar with these types of assessments and may be able to give you some insight and guidance.
Best of luck to you!! Let me know how it goes.
Frances
p.s. Seems that lots more are being let go. What have you been hearing in that regard?
