Hi Bernie,

I thought I would check in and see how you are doing these days.  How's life treating you?  Are you enjoying your job?  How is Ryan doing?  Your "Devices after RIM" email got me thinking about you and hoping you are doing well.

All is well with me.  I'm still enjoying "retirement" and am keeping myself busy.  The kids are fine.  Jeyda is still working at D2L part-time while she finishes school.  She has 2 more terms to go.  They have had lots of layoffs there the last couple of weeks but the plan is she will stay on part-time for now.  I'm sure its very cost efficient for them to keep her on for now.

Ayshen decided at the last minute to take a gap year.  She was able to defer her acceptance so she will start in the Fall.  In the meantime she has been working and planning some travel.  And Levent is fine too - nothing much new with him.

I had lunch with David a couple of weeks back.   He seems well and it was nice to see him again.  Are you keeping in touch with any old RIM friends?  Boy the layoffs just keeping coming there.  I expect it may be a rough Christmas for lots of folks.  Hopefully they will find something quickly.

Anyway, just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you and hope you and your family are well.

Take care,

Frances
