Hi Bernie,
Sorry to hear about Ryan. Is he feeling better now? Perhaps some of these health concerns will motivate him to stop experimenting?! That would be a blessing. I think of you and him often and am always hoping that things will take a turn in the right direction. I know it will happen - its just a matter time and maturity. Growing up is so hard for kids these days.
I'm keeping busy. I am still at the hospital and enjoying it. The gardening is going to be a challenge this year. I need to revitalize my grass after last year's drought. The kids and Levent are well. Nothing much new there.
I hope your job is going well. If you are ever in town let me know. It would be great to catch up.
Take care and let me know how Ryan is doing.
Frances
