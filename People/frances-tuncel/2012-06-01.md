Thanks for passing this along. Her services definitely look interesting.
I hope things are going well with you. Any traction on the job front? How are things with Ryan? How is Janet doing?
I am planning to go to the outplacement services next week. If nothing else my hope is to get a polished resume out of the process so I will have it at the ready if I decide to look again.
Hope all is well and that we can connect at one of these brunches sometime in the not too distant future.
Frances
