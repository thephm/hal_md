I heard a bit [about RIM layoffs] too. Do you know if it was big?
Not good. I heard Marc Provencher is gone. Not sure if you know him.
Cat Coode too
me: Two others I don't know David Ferrone, Dave Bartone
He came to rim about the same time as me - also from mks originally
Seems like lots of people. With Lucias gone are they pulling the plug on Hal?
That's really too bad
I noticed Brian O is a vp - not sure when that happened
And Scotte Zinn is at goggle now
[retirement] is good. I'm keeping busy. No urges to work (not much anyway). There is lots to do.
That's very difficult. We really are the sandwich generation. I hope things get better at work but I'd also say don't settle. Keep looking and you'll eventually find something you love.
Ayshen is up and down. Overall ok. Jeyda is fine. With any luck she will graduate next spring or summer. How's your son. Ryan, right?
Its important to have a good boss and colleagues. Enjoy what you can and ignore the rest.   :)
