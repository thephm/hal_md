Hi Bernie,

Thanks very much for sharing this info!  I have not been hearing much at all.  I'm a bit surprised by the numbers even though I know I should not be.  I'm a bit surprised too that more people we know don't seem to be getting hit.  Let's hope that trend continues.  Perhaps the layoffs are much smaller in software (for the time being anyway).  I doubt that could be the case though, given the numbers.

How is the new job?  I LOVED your newbie sign.  What a great idea.  I also really enjoyed your stats.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I hope all is well with you and your family.
